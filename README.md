# POSPD
POS-constrained Parallel Decoding for Non-autoregressive Generation
### Requirements
### Datasets
We use four datasets to evaluate POSPD, which can be obtained as follows:
- XSUM https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/XSum
- ROCStories Corpus https://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/ We randomly sample 90k/4k stories for training/validation,
and the remaining 4160 for testing. Please first get access to the origin dataset and then contact us for the splited version.
